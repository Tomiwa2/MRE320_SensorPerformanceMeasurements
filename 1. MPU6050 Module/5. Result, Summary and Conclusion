 The main testing process was using a drill as described in the Testing process and setup file. However, as discussed in
that, we only measured the angular acelertaion of the sensor.
  The only component we ran out of time to test for was linearr acceleration. The idea was to use a similar contraption to what
was used by Zarchary(from another group). Basically attached the sensor to a moving object and flipping the sensor 90 degrees to mesure x, y and z axis
Which was basically what we did! We mounted the sensor on an iOLab(a device that has an acceleromter and gyroscope
used in laboratories to measure a lot of quantities including linear and angilar accleration) and then rotated the sensor 90 degrees to measure
both the x,y, z acceleration as well, as can be seen in the testing process file. This enabled us to be able to 
measure linear and even angular cceleration.

    Below are some of our observations and conclusion on the performance of the sensor;

- The sensor testing setup needs a lot of space and outside materials to be able to be properly tested. 

- The sensor is subject to alot of interferences and thus requires complex calibrating anf finetuning in order to accomodate 
these shortcomings 

- The higher the accelerations( both linear and angular) we tried to measure, the harder the measurements and the moreinaccuarate the readings

- Our set up faced considerable downside due to the wiring to the Arduino and the sensors. Additionally, the encoder used was unable to keep up with the high speeds of the motor. 
Overall, we were able to max out the range of the gyroscope at 250 degrees per second. We were also able to achieve repeatability
across some linear acceleration measurements by changing the radius arm. They were all off by a maximum of 15%

                                      Conclusion and improvements
 The sensor actually works well for its intended purpose and cost but a few things could be taken into consideration to
better the testing process and thus make up for the shortcoming of the sensor
> Use 12V motor and something like PWM to control angular velocity
      Verify with better encoder
> Mount motor at exactly horizontal or vertical
> Power Arduino without computer (battery)
> Utilize onboard storage for results when set up is moving

    Taking these improvements into consideration next time, we could better test the performance of the sensor and end up
with more accurate and even reliable results to better quantify the sensor and its efficiency but with what we have, we can safely conclude that
the sensor works well for its purpose and with time and effort, its lack of use in complicated tasks could be compensated!
