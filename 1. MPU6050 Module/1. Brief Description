The first sensor we were assigned was the MPU6050 module/sensor.

  The MPU6050 is a multiaxis accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. It is commonly known as the accelerometer. It features a 
combines 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, a Digital Motion Processor (DMP) and a temperature 
sensor. In our study, we found that it is the world’s first and only 6-axis motion sensor that also doubles 
down as a temperature sensor. 
   Its primary purpose is to measure the two types of acceleration although it can also measure 
temperature. The accelerometer (whose working principle we would see below) measure linear 
acceleration while the gyroscope measures angular acceleration.


Working Principle
    The MPU6050 has a built-in accelerometer that measures linear acceleration. This is done by utilizing electrodes and a proof mass that are interlaced in a comb-like 
structure. The proof mass is free to move in one linear direction and will change distance between its 
“sensing fingers” and the electrodes. This then creates a differential capacitor between the two electrodes 
on either side of the proof masses sensing fingers. The core of this is that the capacitance changes as 
plates are closer or farther away. Finally, the accelerometer uses tiny systems to see how close to plates 
are to each other, and then converts this capacitance reading to an analog signal which is in turn displayed 
to the user. The gyroscope works in a similar way. 

    The gyroscope measures angular acceleration and it does this with a continuously oscillating mass 
and the known physics of the Coriolis effect. Capacitive plates surrounding two masses are able to move 
the masses to create oscillation. They are also the key when determining rotation. This is because the 
capacitance variation will increase with movement of the masses from their expected route. This is how 
the Coriolis effect is measured. These variations are converted to an analog voltage which allows it to be 
read electronically!
