This fourth sensor was one we were not assigned but instead tasked with picking on our own and 
the sensor we chose was The Water Level Detection Sensor Module (HW-038). The HW-038 is very selfdescriptive as it does what it says it does: detect water level. Although its purpose goes beyond just 
detecting water levels as it is also used to monitor a sump pit, detect leaks and even rainfall! It features 
ten copper wires in which 5 are sense traces and the remaining five are power traces. These traces are 
disconnected in the absence of water, but when they are submerged in water, bridges are formed. 
 This is a sensor that we actually do not interact with in our daily lives except there is a need for it! But 
it is one we can easily incorporate if we ever do need it

Working Principle
    The working principle of the sensor is quite simple. The power and sensing traces form a variable 
resistor (similar to a potentiometer) whose resistance value changes based on their exposure to water. This 
resistance is inversely proportional to the depth of immersion of the sensor in the water: the deeper the 
sensor is immersed in the water, the better the conductivity and the lower the resistance. The shallower 
the sensor is immersed in water, the less conductive it is and the higher its resistance. The sensor produces 
an output voltage proportional to the resistance; by measuring this voltage, the water level can thus be 
determined, measured and thus displayed!
