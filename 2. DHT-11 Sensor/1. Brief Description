    The second sensor we were assigned was the DHT-11 module. The DHT-11 is a temperature 
and humidity sensor. It features a resistive-type humidity measurement component, a NTC temperature 
measurement component and an 8-bit microcontroller. Its primary purpose is to measure temperature and 
humidity. 

Working Principle
     The DHT11 sensor consists of a capacitive humidity sensing element and a thermistor for sensing 
temperature. The humidity sensing capacitor has two electrodes with a moisture holding substrate as a 
dielectric between them. So as the humidity changes, the conductivity of the substrate changes or the 
resistance between these electrodesâ€™ changes. The IC then measures, processes this changed capacitance 
values and change them into digital form which is finally read and displayed by the microcontroller 
     On the other hand, for measuring temperature, the DHT-11 uses a Negative Temperature coefficient 
thermistor, which causes a decrease in its resistance value with increase in temperature. This resistance 
change is then measured and converted to temperature which is in turn outputted to the user
