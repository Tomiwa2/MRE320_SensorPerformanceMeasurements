Overall this sensor proved to be quite accurate but with a few shortcomings as well. The testing setup was 
very feasible but quite time consuming and effort draining due to the factors below:
> Due to winter season in which this project was conducted, we most time has to test in extremely cold weather.
At first, we sit in the car with the sensot to keep warm but ended up with highly inaccurate readings.

> To make up for that, the other times we did test, we had to stand out side in the cold to get accurate readings 
and the higher the temperature, the longer time we has to wait for the sensor to pick up that reading 

> Opening and closing the car had a huge impact on the humidity which we could notice in the % error

  In Conclusion, we observed that:

- Temperature adds up everywhere which is why the first time we tried measuring , our readings were off by a considerable amount
which we did not know at that time was our body temperature

- It took about 10 mins or longer for the sensor to go from the previous temperature to the new temperature
(this is where most of the lack of the sensor was coming from  

- The longer the sensor stayed at a temperature the more the drift!

- The higher the temperature we were measuring, the longer the sensor response time (to get to the actual value)

                                                    Improvement
    There is not a lot of improvement that can be done to this setup, temperature spreads really fast and we have to put
it in a completely isolated environment which is almost next to impossible and even if its possible, it is highly difficult
with the setup we have, we would have to completely isolate the sensor and extract the data from outside the setup (which 
is research/industry standard testing). The only improvement we have control over is the time and effort we put into it to 
compensate its response time (which is where most of its lack if not all is coming from!) and with that we can have a almost
