# MRE320_SensorPerformanceMeasurements
MRE 320 Group (3) Project Testing four different types of sensors; Ultrasonic, DHT-11(Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensor), MPU6050(Accelerometer &amp; Gyroscope Sensor) and Water Level Detection Sensor.

This project was all about sensors, thier functions, applications and performance. The performance of a sensor is determined by it's static characteristics and which is what the entirety 
of this project was made up of. We were given the four sensors below to test and measure.
   1. MPU6050 Module
   2. DHT-11
   3. Ultrasonic
   4. Water Level Detection Sensor
We used basic programming knowledge to utilize an Arduino to exatract the data gotten from testing the sensors which we then used to carry out analysis of the senosors

To properly test the performance of these sensors, we got took the actual reading called gound truth of the quantities these sensors measured using a different method/equipment
and then ran a lot of analysis and comparison with the measurement gotten from these sensors to quantify the sensors and thus (the limit of) their performance

**Included in this Repository are**
Brief Description of the sensors
Wiring Diagram and Code used to run the Sensors
The Actual testing Setup
Measured Data and Analysis
Results(including summaryy and conclusion of the project)

   To make sure all necessary information needed to fully understand this project was available, ib this r we included 
The Sensor Testing Proposal which marked the begining of this project and
The Sensor Measurement Presentation which contains all the analaysis done on the sensors.
