The third sensor we were assigned was the Ultrasonic Ranging module (HS-SR04). The HSSR04 is a proximity sensor.
It features two ultrasonic transducers. One is transmitter which outputs 
ultrasonic sound pulses and the other is receiver which listens for reflected waves Its primary purpose is 
to measure distance

Working Principle 
The measurement principle is very simple, generally using the echo time method, that is, 
detecting the time of ultrasonic round trip to the measured distance, when the transmitter emits a short 
pulse, the timer starts; the timer stops immediately when the receiver receives a return pulse. The 
recorded time value at this time is D = CT / 2, where D is the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and 
the measurement object, C is the propagation speed of the sound wave in the medium (C = 331.4 + t273 / 
1m / s, t is the temperature in Celsius), and T is the time interval between ultrasonic emission echoes.
