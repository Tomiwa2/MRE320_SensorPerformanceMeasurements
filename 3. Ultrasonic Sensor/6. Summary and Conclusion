The final result for the ultrasonic sensor turned out quite succesful. Out of all three of the sensors tested, this sensor
appeared to be the most accurate and precise of the three! It was accurate with specification and little to almost no
shortcomings(noise making the most up the shortcoming)which is impressive especially for its intended prurpose, this is probably due to sound being a potent wave

In conclusion, we observed that: 

> Ultrasonic sensor is prone to noise and interference and would work extermely well in isolated environment.

> The smaller the obstacle and closer the sensor to the ground, the larger the intererence

> The manufacturer specifications are close to the measured specifications even with non ideal conclusion

> Due to interference, for application purpose,a special device to help isolate the sound waves for proper propagation is advisable!

Improvement
    There is not a lot of improvement that can be done to this setup, the ultrasonuc sensor is pretty accurate sensor
(which could be due to the fact that it distnace is not a complex quantity) but to get pristine data or even use the sensor
for complex tasks,we would have to completely isolate the sensor in order to eliminate noise and extract the data from outside the setup (which 
is research/industry standard testing) which once again we is almost impossible with all that we have access to. All in all, this sensor 
works well within scope and we can see that in the results of the analysis done on data gotten from the sensor!
